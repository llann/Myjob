## Myjob [![Build Status](https://magnum.travis-ci.com/zifeo/Myjob.svg?token=syrFYEvQ7fayrUQ7Q6nh&branch=deploy)](https://magnum.travis-ci.com/zifeo/Myjob)

Myjob is a job-offering-seeking web-platform developed by the general student association of [Swiss Federal Institute of Technology in Lausanne â€” EPFL](http://www.epfl.ch/index.en.html). It aims to facilitate the meeting of employers and skillful EPFL students (without boring extern subscription) for experiencing working life aside of their studies. The project ([in live here](http://myjob.epfl.ch)) is maintained by the association IT-team and is open source under the [.. LICENSE](./LICENSE) (and `Forking Myjob` rules).

### Mottos

Some of the key features:

- ads creation, modification and full-moderation
- student access for ads viewing and applying
- implicit admin access for moderation
- questions/answers and contact mechanism
- extern ad creation without subscription (managing published ad by mails)
- fully responsive and mobile friendly
- clear and simple interface

### Forking Myjob

When forking Myjob for improvements or your own use you have to consider the following facts:

- project is EPFL-specific but can easily be adapted to your own infrastructure or needs
- further EPFL affiliations are prohibited and controlled by swiss federal laws (basically you have to get rid of all EPFL related media such as name or images)
- further general student association affiliations are prohibited following the same principle
- current users access is using a secure and controlled authentication called [Tequila: Identity Management](https://tequila.epfl.ch), you will have to set up a Tequila server on your own or change authentication mechanism
